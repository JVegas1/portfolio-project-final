          Passionate about technology and driven by an insatiable curiosity, I am a versatile professional with a multifaceted skill set.

          In addition to my technical pursuits, I find joy in continuous learning, seeking to amplify my proficiency by acquiring diverse tech certifications. 
          Each certification serves as a means to comprehend the intricate workings of every component within a system, aspiring to grasp the full picture of technology.
          Devoted to lifelong learning, I am an active member of several tech societies, including Latinas In Cyber, ColorStack, OutInTech, The American Dream Academy, Women Who Code, 
          Software Engineering Association, DevMountain, and Tech Fleet. This involvement reflects my commitment to staying connected with the tech community, fostering diversity, and contributing to the 
          collective growth and knowledge-sharing within the industry.

            My professional journey, rooted in a profound passion for technology, is not just about acquiring skills; it's about creating a meaningful impact. My commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) 
            is not only reflected in my technical prowess but also in my role as the Chair of a DEI Employee Resource Group. This leadership role serves as a testament to my dedication to fostering an inclusive and 
            collaborative workplace culture that celebrates diversity.
            Moreover, I bring a wealth of soft skills crucial for success in today's fast-paced tech landscape. My abilities in cross-functional collaboration, effective communication, a
          daptability, and prioritization are evident in my proven track record of seamlessly integrating into diverse teams. Whether working independently or as part of a collaborative effort, 
          I bring a disciplined approach and a keen sense of prioritization to ensure project success.

                This holistic approach to my personal and professional development positions me as a candidate who not only possesses technical expertise but also understands the interconnected nature of technology.
